Hotbox: A CLI hotkey configurator for Openbox.

Obkey in the Arch Linux AUR relies on an outdated python version.
I wanted to create a quick and easy to use tool to set hotkeys with minimal dependancies.

## Installation

Clone the repo.

## Usage

In the main directory execute python -m hotbox.
Then simply follow on-screen instructions.
